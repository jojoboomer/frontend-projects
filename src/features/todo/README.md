## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Panda CSS](https://nextjs.org/) - Build-time CSS-in-JS library
- [Nanostore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanostores) - State manager ( tasks and theme state )
- [dnd-kit](https://nextjs.org/) - Drag & drop toolkit

### What I learned

I gained practical experience in implementing modern, accessible drag-and-drop functionality using the dnd-kit toolkit. I learned to create sortable lists and interactive components by working with its core concepts like DndContext, sensors, and collision detection algorithms. This project taught me how to manage complex state changes during drag operations, provide visual feedback to users, and build intuitive, responsive interfaces that enhance UX. Working with dnd-kit strengthened my understanding of React component architecture and front-end interactivity.
