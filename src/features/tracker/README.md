## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Panda CSS](https://nextjs.org/) - Build-time CSS-in-JS library
- [IPify](https://www.ipify.org/) - IP Address API
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript library interactive maps

### What I learned

This project gave me hands-on experience integrating two key technologies. I learned to fetch and handle real-time data using the IPify API to retrieve a user's public IP address. Simultaneously, I mastered the fundamentals of Leaflet.js to create dynamic, interactive maps. The core takeaway was successfully connecting these tools: using the IP geolocation data to visually plot and center the user's approximate location on a custom Leaflet map. This practical exercise strengthened my skills in working with external APIs, managing asynchronous JavaScript, and building data-driven, interactive web features.
